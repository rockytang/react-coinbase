# Prices Dashboard
**Prices Dashboard** uses the Coinbase API to refresh BTC and ETH prices every 60 seconds. Feature branches allow users to refresh prices manually and transfer $5 of ether to another address.  
Bonus: Added recommendation to users if they should buy depending on if the latest price is less than the previous price shown.
